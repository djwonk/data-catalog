* [Disclosure Data Catalog](http://www.fec.gov/data/)

Welcome to data.fec.gov. We're building data files that will allow you to
download campaign finance information in ways that we hope are most useful for
you. We'll be moving the data we've always posted on our ftp server to this
new location with these new formats and RSS capabilities. We're also working
on a number of new datasets that will also be available here as we move
forward.

Each of the files listed here can be downloaded in either csv or xml formats.
Each also has a metadata page that describes the information included and the
structure of the file itself. You can also subscribe to RSS feeds for many of
the files so you're notified whenever new data is available or a change is
made.

Finally, there are links to the Commission's Disclosure Data Blog - where
we'll be posting information about the files and our future plans and you can
get help with any questions about the data we're providing here. We're very
interested in your ideas and suggestions, so we hope you'll check in often.
