  description: "Social insurance is any government-sponsored program with the following three characteristics: (1) the benefits, eligibility requirements and other aspects of the program are defined by statute; (2) it is funded by taxes or premiums paid by (or on behalf of) participants (although additional sources of funding may be provided as well); and (3) the program serves a defined population, and participation is either compulsory or the program is heavily enough subsidized that most eligible individuals choose to participate. ... In the U.S., programs that meet these definitions include Social Security, Medicare, the PBGC program, the railroad retirement program and state-sponsored unemployment insurance programs.
